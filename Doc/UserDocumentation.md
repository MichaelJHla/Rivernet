**Introduction: Why Use RiverNET?**
-----------------------------------

RiverNET is a water quality and quantity monitoring program that uses data from
the community in order to check and maintain the ecological health of the
Yellowstone river. RiverNET is unique to the Yellowstone River, using the help
of the community to keep the river as healthy as possible so it can continue to
be a resource used by generations to come.

### **Installation**

No installation is necessary at this time.
