Guide Description: This user guide will provide step by step instructions for
installing, running and using the RiverNET web application.

Introduction: Why Use RiverNET?
-------------------------------

RiverNET is a water quality and quantity monitoring program that uses data from
the community in order to check and maintain the ecological health of the
Yellowstone river. RiverNET is unique to the Yellowstone River, using the help
of the community to keep the river as healthy as possible so it can continue to
be a resource used by generations to come.

### Installation

Currently, the RiverNET application is useable off of the RiverNET web service.
No installation is necessary at this time.

### Running RiverNET software

To run software, start by selecting the quality button on the index page. Once
page loads, the software is ready to be used.

### Using RiverNET software

*Add & Submit Data:*

The RiverNET website includes buttons to submit data as well as to the RiveNET
Git repository. To add data push the “Add Jar” button to create a new jar form
where you can enter in the perspective information fields. Once entered, submit
the data (this can be edited later.). Not every space needs to be filled out
when data is submitted. Once the data is submitted, you can leave the page (no
notification is currently given that data has been submitted).

To edit jar number data, begin by pushing the “Edit” button. Here you can go
through and see recently summited jar data. Find the jar data you want to enter.
