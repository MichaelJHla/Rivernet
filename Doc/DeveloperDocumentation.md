## General Information:

    - RiverNET’s database is hosted by and links to Firebase.

## Developer Tools:

    - How to Obtain Stable Source code: Our source code can currently be found in the Git Repo 

    linked below:

  	Stable code (https://github.com/MichaelJHla/Rivernet)

    - Source Code: Our source code can be pulled for the git repository linked below:

## Testing:

    - How to Build: Currently tests do not need to be built. The local machine requires the code linter JShint to run the basic tests. The command to install it globally is: _npm install -g jshint_.

    - How to Test: Tests can be run on local machines by running the command “_npm test_”. The tests will fail unless the local machine has installed the JSHint code linter. 

    - Set up automated build & test: We set up Travis to automatically run the tests as a git push is fulfilled. Travis automatically runs tests every time the Github repo is pushed to. 

## Version Control:

    - Updating Revision Numbers: Revision numbers will be used as follows: v1.0 for out first 

    release after the beta and alpha releases. Afterwards, numbers will change by the tenths, 

    v1.1, v1.2, etc. until a second version is ready to be released.

    - Create .zip files: This feature is not currently supported by RiverNET.

    - Copying files to website:  This feature is not currently supported by RiverNET.

    - Sanity-checking:  This feature is not currently supported by RiverNET.

## Bugs Reporting: 

    - How to access bug lists: To report a bug navigate to the _issues _section of the Github repo and create a new issue. Make sure to properly name the bug and describe exactly your issue before creating the issue. Ensure that the issue is also properly labeled, so that developers can easily determine what an issue is among the list of others.  Currently, no user reported bug lists exist. Resolved and unresolved developer Issues can be viewed on Github.
